# Advanced Financial Mathematics Study Plan

This repository documents my personal 12-week PhD-level study of financial 
mathematics, inspired by the curricula of NYU Courant, Princeton ORFE, and 
ETH Zurich.

Each week includes:
- LaTeX problem sets (proof-based)
- Python simulations
- Mini-projects
- A final research paper

## Structure

- "problem_sets/": Weekly LaTeX writeups  
- "code/": Python simulations and tools  
- "mini_projects/": Formal writeups on core topics like FTAP and arbitrage  
- "capstone/": Final research paper on exotic option pricing under 
stochastic volatility  
- "references/": Key research papers and citations
